D-GLAS means 'Dé'- Game Library Administration System

'Le Dé Masqué' (The Masked Dice) is a french association based in Dijon which
want to give to the world the opportunity to play boardgames in a dedicated place.
This place is a café with aprox. 900 boardgames available to play with and 50 volunteers
that are able to explain the rules so you don't have to read it :D

So, to manage this boardgames, we needed an application to follow each game
- in / out
- numbers
- degradation state
- missing parts
- localisation
- lost

We choose to initiate this administration system with an symfony backoffice, front with be 
design later with angular (most probably). The first version of this backoffice can be find
on D-GLAS repository. This version D-GLAS2 is an upgrade to php7.4 and symfony 4.4.

Thanks for your help.
